Now let's practice linking static files to our template. For this project, we'll render a template that displays a checkerboard:

Your program should have the following output

<li>1. http://localhost:5000 - should display 8 by 8 checkerboard</li><br>

<li>2. http://localhost:5000/4 - should display 8 by 4 checkerboard</li><br>

<li>3. http://localhost:5000/(x)/(y) - should display x by y checkerboard.  For example, http://localhost:5000/10/10 should display 10 by 10 checkerboard.  Before you pass x or y to Jinja, please remember to convert it to integer first (so that you can use x or y in a for loop)</li><br>

<b>HINT: Remember that values from urls come in as strings by default. If you want to use the value in a loop, you should convert it to an integer before passing it to Jinja.</b><br>
